# Mountain Madness 2023 Submission: Whisper

This is my example yell game for <a href="https://sfu.ca">SFU</a>'s <a href="https://sfucsss.org">CSSS</a>'s Spring Mountain Madness hackathon.
Ironically, this game is called 'whisper.'
This is essentially a game version of the popular word game 'telephone.'
